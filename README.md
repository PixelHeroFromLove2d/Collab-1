# ___Collab-1___
Hi! I wish to create a platformer using the Love2d framework. May I please have help? I WILL update this later.



I am thinking that the finished platformer should be about a wild turkey, whose parents have been taken to a farm to become Thanksgiving dinner, and your little turkey, we'll call him `Robert` from now on, must rescue them before they get eaten.

Problem is, in this little demo, I have no levels, no character. If anyone is out there who can do collisions in Tiled and use a Tiled map, ***I need your help***, so ___please___ help me!
